/**
 * We call the audio routing, mixing, and effects part of the d8b
 * "audio".  Everything in and under this package pertains to
 * interacting with the audio capabilities of the d8b.
 * <p/>
 * The audio side of the d8b is controlled by the second of the two
 * RS-422 lines in the DB25 cable (based at pin 6, i.e., ten pins over
 * from the start of the console set).
